**More about me and my plugins**

Since the year 1999 I do administration, customizing and programming for several forums, communities and social networks. In the year 2013 I switched from another PHP framework to Wordpress.
Because not all plugins I'd like to have exist already I wrote some own plugins and I think I'll continue to do so.

If you have the scope at forums or social networks my other modules might also be interesting for you. [Just take a look at my Wordpress Profile to see all my Plugins.](http://wordpress.org/plugins/search.php?q=quan_flo "ifs-net / quan_flo Wordpress Plugins") Use them and if my work helps you to save time, earn money or just makes you happy feel free to donate - Thanks. The donation link can be found at the right sidebar next to this text.
